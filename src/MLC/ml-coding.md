# <a name="ml-coding"></a> 2. ML/Data Coding :robot:

This page is the canonical index for ML coding interview practice. Work through one category at a time: implement the prompt without looking, compare with the linked answer, test edge cases, and explain the trade-offs aloud.

The catalog is intentionally divided by interview skill rather than framework:

1. **Classic ML** — algorithms, data preparation, metrics, and training fundamentals.
2. **Language Models (LM)** — tokenization, attention, decoding, and sequence batching.
3. **Generative AI (GenAI)** — adaptation, retrieval, preference learning, and generation primitives.
4. **Agentic AI coding** — tools, orchestration, memory, retries, permissions, and termination.

Every catalog row has an answer. Python answers are deliberately interview-sized and self-contained; a few established visual exercises use an existing notebook as their answer.

## How to use this chapter

1. Pick a question and restate its input, output, shapes, and assumptions.
2. Implement a correct baseline without opening the answer.
3. Test a normal case and at least one boundary or failure case.
4. Compare with the linked answer, then discuss complexity and production trade-offs.
5. Revisit **Easy** questions in 15 minutes, **Medium** questions in 20–35 minutes, and **Hard** questions in 40–60+ minutes.

Run all Python answer tests from the repository root:

```bash
uv run --with numpy python -m unittest discover -s src/MLC/tests -p "test_*.py"
```

## Extended practice

- [PyTorch ML Coding Problems](./pytorch-ml-coding.md) is the extended framework-specific drill bank. It is supplementary; the four tables above are the canonical question index.
- [Legacy notebooks](./notebooks/) remain available for visual and exploratory practice. The canonical tables link only the notebooks used as current answers or supplements.
- [Agentic AI Systems interview prep](https://github.com/alirezadir/Agentic-AI-Systems/tree/main/06_interview_prep) covers the system-design layer that complements the agentic coding exercises here.

## Difficulty and company-tag policy

- **Easy:** one focused operation, usually about 15 minutes.
- **Medium:** multiple steps or meaningful edge cases, usually 20–35 minutes.
- **Hard:** interacting components, advanced debugging, or systems trade-offs, usually 40–60+ minutes.

Difficulty is an editorial judgment about the complete prompt. Exact matches were calibrated against [TorchLeet](https://github.com/Exorust/TorchLeet) and [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems); unmatched prompts use the same scope-based rubric. Company tags appear only when a reference associates the company with the same implementation problem. They are historical preparation signals, not claims about a current interview loop. This repository uses metadata only and does not copy third-party prompts or answers.

## What to explain during the interview

1. State shapes, dtypes, assumptions, and expected outputs before coding.
2. Start with a correct baseline, then optimize the bottleneck.
3. Discuss time and space complexity, including large intermediate matrices and model state.
4. Handle numerical stability, empty inputs, invalid labels, ties, and permission boundaries.
5. Write a normal-case test and at least one failure or boundary test.
6. Explain how the answer changes for large datasets, GPUs, distributed execution, or production services.
